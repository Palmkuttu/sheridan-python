## Description
This project implements a function that generates the **prime factors** of a given integer using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

The assignment follows the **Three Rules of TDD**:

3. Refactor if needed, then commit  

Each step includes:
- A new test
- Minimal implementation
- A Git commit
